# React-Practices-Basic

This repository is where I've organized the code I've written while completing a ReactJS course, each branch represents a different ReactJS development practice. Through this course, I've gained experience in a range of ReactJS features, from building reusable components to managing state with Redux.

I've organized the code into branches to make it easy for others to access and learn from. By exploring the different branches, users can gain a deeper understanding of ReactJs best practices and improve their skills in various areas.

Overall, this repository has been a valuable resource for me to improve my skills and learn new practices in ReactJS development. The range of development practices covered in this repository has helped me to grow as a ReactJS developer and hone my skills in building scalable, maintainable, and efficient applications. I hope others can benefit from it as well.
